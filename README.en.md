> ONE BLOCK SUBJECT · VIVID SOURCE COLOUR · MATTE ABS · QUIET FIELD · MODULAR TYPE

XXD Panel 035 is an image-generation Skill for Codex and compatible agents. It understands the source's identity, action, relation, and implication, then rebuilds the defining subject as one recognisable LEGO/Minecraft-like voxel sculpture through cubic proportion, modular geometry, plausible assembly, clean silhouette, and source-earned local exaggeration.

Vivid source-derived colour, credible matte ABS plastic, visible seams, stepped thickness, natural contact shadows, one minimal base or plane, and a quiet low-information field create a premium toy-brand art object or modern design collectible rather than a game screenshot.

## Why it exists

“LEGO/Minecraft style” easily collapses into a complex game world, generic character asset, loose-brick floor, glossy CGI toy render, or childish interface.

035 reverses that logic:

```text
lock identity / action / function / relation → preserve at least three source cues → rebuild one clean block silhouette → organise cubic and modular hierarchy with plausible joints and thickness → apply source-earned local exaggeration → clarify vivid source-derived colour groups → render matte ABS, seams, and contact shadows → retreat the environment to a light quiet field → align restrained modular copy
```

If an unrelated photograph could replace the source without materially changing the block silhouette, modular hierarchy, local exaggeration, colour identity, seam placement, base relation, or typography, the result is not 035.

## The 035 visual contract

- **Source identity:** at least three specific cues preserve contour, pose, direction, proportion, opening, overlap, distance, and relation.
- **One recognisable block subject:** silhouette, pose, direction, function, opening, overlap, proportion, colour, and relation preserve at least three source cues.
- **Plausible modular assembly:** cubic units, stepped layers, visible thickness, seams, joints, overlaps, and weight distribution feel buildable.
- **Vivid source colour:** high-purity, high-saturation block groups preserve the source's combined identity without a fixed primary kit.
- **Credible matte ABS:** restrained plastic highlights and natural contact shadows reveal thickness without metal, glass, mirror gloss, or excessive CGI.
- **Quiet display field:** one minimal base, plane, or shadow supports the subject while the lighter low-information background and whitespace make it absolute focus.
- **Restrained modular type:** native pixel, modular, or instruction-manual typography aligns with silhouette, base, seam, module rhythm, or whitespace.

These samples demonstrate the 035 aesthetic motive. Their subjects, composition, palette, copy, and earlier canvas ratio never become generation references or current defaults.

## Four combinable output modes

Choose one or several modes with `1`, `1+3`, `1,2,4`, or `all`; `all` produces seven separate PNGs per source. After mode selection and before generation, the Skill explicitly asks for the whole finished canvas: the original-prompt `3:4`, an explicit source-aspect choice, a common ratio, or custom ratio/exact pixels. Source dimensions are never applied silently.

| Mode | Canvas rule | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `top-bottom` | user-confirmed whole canvas | one complete generation: high-fidelity source above, 035 design below, approximately 50/50 |
| `left-right` | user-confirmed whole canvas | one complete generation: high-fidelity source left, 035 design right, approximately 50/50 |
| `design-only` | user-confirmed whole canvas | 035 design fills the canvas; source remains invisible |
| `wallpaper-pack` | confirmed per device | separate phone, iPad, desktop, and children's-watch PNGs |

Paired modes use the source as a high-fidelity edit/reference input and one complete style prompt to generate the finished composition directly, so photography, design, colour, light, typography, and meaning can cohere. Deterministic composition is fallback-only: after one targeted complete-canvas retry fails, when pixel-identical source preservation is explicitly required, when the active route cannot realise the canvas, or for lossless final pixel calibration.

Wallpapers may be linked or independent. A linked pack approves one iPad anchor, then recomposes every other device from the original plus that same anchor. An independent pack gives each device only the original. Neither crops another device output nor chains derivatives.

## Copy behaves like modular auxiliary design

Before generation, choose automatic copy, custom copy, or text-free output. Name the target language or locale whenever copy is present.

Automatic copy derives one concise title from subject identity, action, emotion, relation, or supported meaning. It adds zero to two grounded tags or micro-notes only when useful and never invents a brand, set number, game level, product line, or specification.

Use natural native modular, pixel, or instruction-manual typography aligned with the subject silhouette, base, block seam, module rhythm, or active whitespace. Preserve exact wording and avoid game HUD, toy logos, arcade display type, retail labels, and pseudo-set metadata. Copy must pass the unrelated-image swap test.

Finished user wording stays verbatim. A direction or editable draft is refined only while preserving audience, purpose, mandatory words, tone, and implication.

Language follows the intended audience rather than the command language:

```text
target market or audience > requested output language > direction language; if none is explicit, ask before generation
```

A Japanese edition uses natural Japanese, a Korean-audience edition uses natural Korean and correct spacing, a UK edition uses British English, and Arabic defaults to natural Modern Standard Arabic with genuine right-to-left composition. The Skill never guesses nationality from appearance, clothing, scenery, or signs and never uses pseudo-foreign text.

## Complete-canvas first, raster-only delivery

The image model owns the aesthetics of the entire finished composition; paired layouts also default to one complete-canvas generation. `scripts/compose_panel.py` remains only for condition-based recovery, lossless pixel calibration, and read-only audit. It is not run pre-emptively and does not judge aesthetic success.

Every deliverable is a raster PNG and every invocation creates a fresh task under `~/Desktop/xxd/`. The configured image route exposes sanitised status only—never providers, endpoints, credentials, headers, prompts, responses, or account details. SVG, HTML, Canvas, diagrams, and programmatic drawing are not substitutes for the final artwork.

## Selectable controls and inline parameters

When the host provides genuine interactive controls, the Skill prefers card-style selection: output modes and ordinary output sizes are multi-select, while copy mode and wallpaper relationship are single-select. Size choices include auto-fit, source aspect, 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9, 5:7, 7:5, and custom ratios or pixels. Without an interactive control, it falls back to a clear multiline numbered menu rather than showing fake checkboxes.

Every setting can also be supplied as an inline variable:

```text
/xxd-panel-035 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom,design-only --size auto,3:4,9:16 --text auto --locale ja-JP
```

Supported parameters include `--mode`, repeatable or comma-separated `--size`, `--text auto|custom|none`, `--locale`, `--copy`, `--wallpaper linked|independent`, `--wallpaper-size`, and `--out`. Complete parameters skip all preflight questions; partial parameters trigger only the missing questions. Different aspect ratios are independently recomposed, and the four-device wallpaper pack remains a separate branch rather than being multiplied by ordinary sizes.

## Image-model priority

GPT Image 2 is the default first choice. It keeps this project's established workflow: high-fidelity source reference, explicit whole-canvas selection before generation, one complete-canvas generation for paired modes, and scripted composition only as a conditional fallback.

Seedance 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Pro), Nano Banana 2 (Gemini Image Flash), or another compatible bitmap model may also be used when it is actually available through the current tools or configured routes and can satisfy source fidelity, whole-canvas ratio, target-language text, and linked-wallpaper multi-reference requirements. An alternative changes only the generation route; it must not change modes, canvas, copy, locale, wallpaper relationship, or the complete-canvas-first strategy.

If no suitable route is available, the Skill asks the user to enable an image-generation tool or provide an API key. User-provided credentials may be used for the current task without being echoed, displayed, logged, or exposed. They are not persisted, and provider, account, billing, or global route configuration is not modified, unless the user explicitly requests that configuration change.

## Get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-035.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/xxd-panel-035" ~/.codex/skills/xxd-panel-035
```

Claude Code users may link the same directory to `~/.claude/skills/xxd-panel-035`. Restart the agent session after installation.

```text
$xxd-panel-035
Turn this photograph into a left-right composition. Derive the copy from the image and write it in natural Korean.
```

You may invoke the Skill with only a photograph. It first asks for one or more modes in a numbered multiline menu, then for copy settings; wallpaper mode also asks for linked/independent continuity and device sizes.

## Boundaries and trust

- Each photograph stays within its own task and never borrows subjects, colours, copy, or composition from other inputs, old results, or samples.
- Every invocation creates a fresh task directory; even identical sources and parameters must generate anew.
- Deliverables are PNG bitmaps, never SVG, HTML, Canvas, or programmatic-drawing substitutes.
- The configured bitmap bridge emits sanitised status only and does not expose providers, endpoints, headers, credentials, prompts, or response bodies.
- Each selected ordinary mode returns one file; selected `wallpaper-pack` adds four separate wallpapers. `all` returns seven PNGs per source across four sibling mode directories, never a contact sheet or overview.

Local composition needs Python 3 and Pillow. The safe bitmap bridge uses Python 3.11+ `tomllib`. Image generation still requires a host agent with built-in raster generation or an already configured compatible raster route.
